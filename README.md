# MusicGenreClassifier

Machine learning basic principles course project: Learn to classify a music genre based audio data.

We compare the performance of a neural network design found in research literature, with more classical methods such as classification by support vector machine and the Bayes classifier. In the end, a support vector machine combined with dimensionality reduction resulted in the best accuracy.
